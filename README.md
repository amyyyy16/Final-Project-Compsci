Final-Project-Compsci
Game that Mel and I built 

This won't run unless you have Renpy on your computer, we didn't upload it to a game store because there are legal implications in doing so.

In the repository includes the script, the gui, the screens, and the options.

It also includes extras that we either put in the game or decided against putting in the game

There are also other files that renpy requires to run, I decided to put that in just incase

The only files that Mel or I edited are the script, the gui, the screens, and the options.

The flow chart is named "Final Project Flow Cart"

If you have any questions just ask.

Thank you for a great semester, it was fun.
